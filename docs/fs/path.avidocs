The Path class represents an absolute path.

Each path must start with a slash. (Because each path is absolute).
Each directory path also ends with a slash; But a file path does not.

The constructor gets a string path as a parameter; But if the path is illegal, then nothing will happen.
Therefore always check is_legal() before doing anything.
