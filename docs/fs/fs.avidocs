The FS class represents an abstract file system.

It has two basic operations:
read(Path path, size_t count, size_t offset, char* buf) - reads <count> bytes from file <path>, starting from <offset> into <buf>.
write(Path path, size_t count, size_t offset, char* buf) - writes <count> bytes into file <path>, starting from <offset>, from <buf>.

It is important to emphasize that write() DOES NOT discard the previous file contents!
